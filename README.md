## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- SVG icons

### What I learned

This project was usefull to learn both Grid and Flex boxes while also combining them to achieve a different look on desktop than on mobile. On top of that I've learned how to work with SVG and alter their properties from css

### Continued development

Next steps are to refine my understanding of Grid Box
### Useful resources

- [CSS Color Filter Generator ](https://angel-rs.github.io/css-color-filter-generator/) - This helped me generate a filter attribute in order to more easily change the svg color from css
- [Kevin Powell - Learn CSS Grid the easy way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rg7Fvvl3taU) - Short explanatory video of CSS Grid and how to work with it
